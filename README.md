## Data Structures and Algorithm
- Algorithm: In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.
- Data Structures: Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

## Types of Data Structure
- **Linear Data Structures: the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.**
   1. Array Data Structure
   2. Stack Data Structure
   3. Queue Data Structure
   4. Linked List Data Structure
- **Non-Linear Data Structures: elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.**
1. Graph Data Structure
2. 2. Trees Data Structure
